# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This is a repository to keep track of my progress on the challenge from https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/

It will be making use of Python's built-in sqlite3 and Pandas library to create a database/tables and read the queries into DataFrames to answer the questions.
Since SQLite will be used, there will small variations in SQL dialect but the overarching themes should remain the same.

For more information on these libaries, feel free to visit:

* [Python's Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Python's sqlite3 docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
* [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

### Objective:
My goal is to put my SQL knowledge to the test and fill the gaps where necessary.
I am adding my own twist to the challenge where I will be answering the questions in Python in addition to SQL with the caveat:
* This approach has helped me work through and solidify my understanding of SQL sytnax structure.
* The answers I provide may not be the only way to solve the questions and there may be more efficient ways at deriving the same results. 
* I may have answered a question incorrectly or missed something, if so please let me know so that I can re-work the problem or learn something new.
